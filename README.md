# Coffee-Quality-Analysis-with-Power-BI
This project explores the relationship between processing methods, origin regions, defects, and sensory attributes that influence coffee quality, as indicated by Total Cup Points. Using data provided by the Coffee Quality Institute (CQI), the analysis aims to identify key determinants of coffee quality and how they impact the overall score.

Project Highlights:

Data Exploration: Analyzed factors such as processing methods, origin regions, defect occurrences, and sensory attributes (e.g., aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, balance, and body).
Visualizations: Developed interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize the relationships between these factors and their influence on Total Cup Points.
Decision Support: The visualizations empower coffee producers to make informed decisions regarding cultivation and processing to improve coffee quality.
